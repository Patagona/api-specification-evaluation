Wrapper for https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator

```shell script
npm install
./convert.sh
```

## Converts
- OpenAPI 3.0 :arrow_right: TypeScript
    - angularjs
- OpenAPI 3.0 :arrow_right: Scala
    - Scalatra

## Problems
- does not respect hierarchy
    - `allOf` should create hiearchies
    
## Examples
```scala
